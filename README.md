# My ZSA Moonlander Config

[TSFoster's macOS layout](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/bdD07/latest/0)

This repository contains a copy of the source downloaded from the above link, a [tool for testing keystroke timings](./keystroke-times.html), and this README, which outlines aims and future changes.

## Requirements

1. Wherever possible, all keys should be Cmd+key when held
2. Meh/hyper shortcuts should be easy to perform (as I make heavy use of them on macOS)
3. Need to be able to do Cmd+Alt+Esc (but can be in deep layer)
4. Cmd+Space (Alfred) in one accessible tap
5. Shift should be on both sides (both for one-handed typing, and for reducing the number of times one hand must hold multiple keys)
6. All modifiers and tab should be consistent across all layers
7. Esc should be easily accessible
8. Switching to layers, and returning to L0 should be consistent between layers

## TODO

* Think about lessons that can be taken from vim philosophy
  * Consider how to further reduce chording
    * Make full use of layers to emulate multi-stroke keymaps (NB Oryx supports up to 32 layers)
  * Should layer 0 be 'normal' mode, layer 1 as 'insert' mode?!
* Consider whether removing requirement 1 could allow for any interesting features
